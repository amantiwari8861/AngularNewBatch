After downloading the project, open the Node command prompt and navigate to the mCart folder as shown below, and run the 'npm install' command to install the npm packages.

D:\mCart>npm install

This will create a folder called node_modules with all the dependencies installed inside it

Note: Sometimes Angular will throw errors during installation. This can be due to the unavailability of some additional dependencies in your machine. After installation, always check if the node_modules folder is created under the project root folder. If it is created, you can ignore the errors that occurred during installation.

 

Type the following command to run the application. This will open a browser with the default port as 4200.

    D:\mCart>ng serve --open
